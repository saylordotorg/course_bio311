**Unit 2: Nucleic Acids and Proteins: Structure and Function** <span
id="2"></span> 
*Nucleic acids and proteins are biopolymers. Nucleic acids are
nucleotide polymers, while proteins are amino acid polymers. DNA is a
polynucleotide, which typically has double helical 3D structure. RNA is
a polynucleotide as well, but its 3D structure is more versatile. Some
proteins and some RNA molecules act as biological catalysts and regulate
cellular metabolism. *

    dsDNA, then the structure is the B-form unless otherwise indicated.
    The B-form was discovered by Franklin and Gosling (see unit 1).  The
    DNA strands in the B-form are in antiparallel orientation.  A
    right-handed helix spirals away from the viewer in a clockwise
    manner.

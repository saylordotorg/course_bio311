**Unit 3: Chromosome, Chromatin, and Nucleosome** <span id="3"></span> 
*DNA is packed into chromosomes in cells. The structure of the
chromosome is constantly changing based on the metabolic activities
within the cell. The degree of chromosome condensation is regulated by
protein modifications and by the nucleosome remodeling complex.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 12.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.1: 0.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.2: 4.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.3: 3.0 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.4: 3.0 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.5: 1.5 hours

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Describe the structure of the chromosome.
-   Discuss the role of histones in packaging eukaryotic DNA. 
-   Compare and contrast heterochromatin and euchromatin.
-   Discuss how the nucleosome remodeling complex regulates gene
    activity. 
-   Discuss the consequence of histone modifications in eukaryotes.

     Instruction: Please study this page.  Please note that eukaryotes
    have their chromosomes in the nucleus, which is a membrane-bound
    subcellular organelle.  Prokaryotes have no subcellular organelles;
    their chromosomes are in their cytoplasm.

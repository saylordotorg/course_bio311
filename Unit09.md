**Unit 9: DNA Recombination and Transposition** <span id="9"></span> 
*Recombination and transpositions permanently alter DNA sequences.
Recombination contributes to DNA repair and it increases genetic
variation. Transposition events also increase genetic variation, and
they can result in new domain combinations in proteins through exon
shuffling.*

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Describe the crossing over event during meiosis I.
-   Compare and contrast the Holliday and the double-stranded break
    models.
-   Compare recombination and transposition and the roles they play in
    genetic diversity. 
-   Compare and contrast genomic insertions of jumping genes and
    retroviruses.
-   Describe the consequence of genomic mobile element insertions
    including the McClintock experiment. 
-   Explain how RecA and RecBCD work during recombination.
-   Predict the consequence of exon shuffling in specific genes.

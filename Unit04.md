**Unit 4: DNA Replication** <span id="4"></span> 
*High fidelity characteristics of DNA replication ensure that cell
proliferation results in genetically identical daughter cells.  DNA
polymerases synthesize a complement strand on the template strand, but
the cooperation of many other proteins is needed as well.  First the
strands of the dsDNA must be separated, and then a primer should be
provided before the DNA polymerase can start to work. DNA polymerase
continuously copies one strand of the dsDNA, but the complement is
copied in pieces and must be ligated.  Circular dsDNA replicates to two
identical dsDNA.  Linear dsDNA becomes shorter with each round of
replication, because DNA polymerases have only 5'–\>3' activity and
cannot replace RNA primers.  This is why telomere regions become shorter
and shorter during aging.*

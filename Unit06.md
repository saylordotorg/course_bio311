title: "BIO311: Molecular Biology"
course_description: "A detailed exploration of the structure and function of DNA and RNA and how these nucleic acids are used to form proteins, and their importance in genetics and inheritance. Special emphasis is placed on DNA replication, transcription, gene expression, mutation and repair, recombination, molecular techniques, and appropriate molecular models."

**Unit 6: Protein Synthesis and the Genetic Code** <span id="6"></span> 
*Protein synthesis is the translation of nucleic acid sequence to
protein sequence.  The nucleic acid sequence is read in triplets; each
triplet codes for only one amino acid.  The genetic code is said to be
universal, since a mRNA is translated into the same protein in a variety
of distantly related organisms.  Protein synthesis takes place in the
cytosol on free ribosomes and on rough ER-bond ribosomes.   *

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Compare mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA.
-   Discuss how the genetic code is interpreted by specific aminoacyl
    tRNA transferase enzymes.
-   Describe the ribosomal structure; compare and contrast free
    ribosomes and bound ribosomes. 
-   Compare and contrast the initiation of translation in prokaryotes
    and eukaryotes.

**Unit 11: Model Organisms** <span id="11"></span> 
*Many model organisms are used in molecular biology, both in research
and in biotechnology.  They help to answer questions on the function of
the genes, and they can be engineered to produce a variety of
substances.  The simplest of all is* E. coli*, the working horse of any
cloning protocol.  *C. elegans*and* D. melanogaster *taught us the
function of many genes.  A. thaliana has been widely employed in GMO
plan pilot experiments.  As a general rule, always the simplest possible
model organism is employed for a certain task.  If post-translational
modification is not essential, then proteins can be produced in* E.
coli*, but a eukaryotic model organism is the right choice if
post-translational modification is essential.  You can see an array of
applications if you take the [BIO403:
Biotechnology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio403/) course.*

    is a prokaryote, thus it lacks membrane-bound subcellular
    organelles.

     Instructions: Please watch the video (24 min) for an overview of
    viruses.  Bacteriophages are viruses that infect only bacteria.
     Viruses are in the grey zone between life and the non-living world.
     A virus can multiple only in its specific host cell, while it takes
    over the host's metabolic activities.  The host range describes the
    cells that can be infected by a certain virus.  Viruses may destroy
    their host in a lytic cycle or incorporate themselves into the
    host's genome. Viruses are used in a broad range of biotechnology
    applications, including gene therapy and phage therapy.

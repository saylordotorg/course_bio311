**Unit 8: DNA Mutation and Repair** <span id="8"></span> 
*DNA mutation is a permanent change in the DNA sequence.  Such a change
may be neutral or good or bad for the cell.  A mutation is neutral if it
does not affect the expression or function of any gene product.  Rarely,
it is good if it brings advantage for the organism or for the offspring
of the organism.  Sometimes it is bad if it is disadvantageous, e.g., if
it results in cancer or other disease.  DNA polymerases have
proofreading activity and work to keep the DNA unchanged.  There are
cellular defense mechanisms in multi-cellular organisms, e.g.,
programmed cell death, which work toward eliminating mutated cells.  You
can learn about programmed cell death in [BIO402:
Pathobiology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio402/) or [BIO404: Cancer
Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio404/) courses in the Biology
Program.  In general, mutations may arise from two sources: internal
mistakes in gene replication or external mutagens.  *

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Compare and contrast single-base mutations and mutations that affect
    long(er) DNA sequences.
-   Compare and contrast sense, missense, and nonsense mutations. 
-   Describe several mutations that cause human disease.
-   Compare and contrast DNA damage types
-   Describe biological repair mechanisms.

**Unit 7: Regulation of Gene Expression** <span id="7"></span> 
*The synthesis of a complementary RNA strand from a DNA template takes
place in somewhat different ways in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes, as
you learned in Unit 5.  In this unit you will study gene expression in
more detail.  Synchronized gene expression on prokaryotes is directed in
operons, wherein certain genes that are next to each other are regulated
by the binding or not binding of a repressor to an upstream region.  In
the case of eukaryotes, transcription is synchronizing expression of
genes that are scattered throughout the chromosome(s).  In eukaryotes,
genes are expressed only if a set of enhancers are present and a complex
transcription initiation complex can form.  This can lead to tissue- and
activity-specific gene expression, when distant genes express the same
set of enhancers.  Epigenetics means "in addition to" genetics, and it
is studying why genes with identical sequences are expressed
differently.  Epigenetic changes are chemical modifications (not
sequence changes) that living organisms pick up during their life as a
response to environmental stimuli, e.g., nutrition.  The result is
turning genes off and on, through making the chromosomal structure more
or less compact.  The more compact structure interferes with gene
transcription.*

     Instruction: Please study the "RNA Polymerase and Transcription"
    section on this page.  Please note that in prokaryotes, the genes
    that should be expressed at the same time are often located next to
    each other.

     Instruction:  Please study the "Repressors and Negative Control of
    Transcription" and "Positive Control of Transcription" sections on
    this page.  Please note that the repressor inhibits transcription
    unless it is inactivated by the inducer.  The inducer is allolactose
    for *Lac* operon. Inducible operons are common in the regulation of
    catabolic pathways.

     Instruction:  Please study the "Transcriptional Attenuation"
    section on this page.  Please note that the repressor cannot
    interfere with transcription unless it is activated by the
    co-repressor. The co-repressor is tryptophan for *Trp* operon.
     Repressible operons are common in the regulation of anabolic
    pathways.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instruction: Please study this page.  Epigenetics refers to
    anything that changes gene expression without changing the DNA
    sequence of the genome.  These changes are chemical modifications,
    e.g., DNA methylation and histone acethylation.  Epigenetic changes
    turn genes on and off in the genome.

**Unit 1: Discovery of DNA and The Gene** <span id="1"></span> 
*The twisted ladder shape has become the symbol of genetics; it stands
for the double stranded DNA. The basic principles of inheritance, the
nature of DNA, and its significance in inheritance were all synthesized
from experimental findings of scientists who were trained in a variety
of disciplines. The inheritance patterns of traits were described
without knowing the underlying molecular mechanisms, and the composition
of DNA was determined without knowing its significance in inheritance.
By 1950, it was determined that DNA is the hereditary material. In 1953,
the structure of the DNA was published: the twisted ladder.*

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Discuss the timeline of major discoveries in genetics.
-   Identify the genotype and phenotype of offspring if the inheritance
    is Mendelian.
-   Compare and contrast dominant, recessive, and co-dominant alleles.
-   Discuss genetic recombination, which is the exchange of genes
    between homologous chromosomes.

-   Discuss the purification of nuclein and the identification of its
    composition.
-   Compare and contrast the Griffith and Avery experiments.
-   Compare and contrast the experiments that identified DNA as the
    transforming and DNA as the hereditary material.
-   Describe the experimental evidence and reasoning leading to the
    identification of DNA as the molecule that carries genetic
    information, as opposed to proteins, RNA, or other cellular
    metabolites.
-   Discuss the double helix model of DNA and the relative contributions
    of Chargaff, Crick, Franklin, Levene, and Watson to its experimental
    verification.
-   Describe the semi-conservative replication of DNA, its experimental
    evidence, and competing theories.

    knowledge on inheritance and DNA is very recent.  The timeline of
    some of the great discoveries in DNA research is listed here.  It
    may help you to see these dates together with the time when, for
    example, color TV, air conditioning, or plastic was invented.

    (Adobe Flash)  
        
     Instructions: Please watch the video (26 min) for a step-by-step
    tutorial on using Punnett squares to determine how alleles of more
    than one gene assort independently.  During sexual reproduction both
    parents pass on some of their traits to their offspring(s). 
    Mendel's law of segregation describes how different versions of one
    trait are combined in the offspring.  Mendel's law of independent
    assortment describes how different versions of different traits are
    combined in the offspring.  Please make sure that you can predict
    the genotype and phenotype of the F1 generation using Punnett
    squares.  You may need to follow this video several times.  Be
    patient; it may take some time to get used to the Punnett squares. 
    This is a great tool, used every day in genetic counseling.
